[Link to the webpage](https://cleggatron.github.io/RandomPasswordGenerator/)


This webpage provides prompts that allow the user to generate a custom password, with varying levels of complexity. The user can select between lowercase, uppercase, number, and symbols. THe user can also specify the length, though enforced minimum/maximum lengths are included.

## Installation

As this is a webpage then there is no installation required.

## Usage

Once the user clicks the "Generate Password" button they will receive sequential prompts where they chose the length and complexity of the password. 

The character types chosen are stored in an array which then allows for access to the arrays of available characters. The program loops through this for the total length of the array.
